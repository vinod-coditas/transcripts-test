Call Transcript:\n Good morning, Mr. Tim. Yeah, I hate Tim. It's all over Connected Cell. We spoke last month about Connected Cell and he needs to be sent an email and call back at a better time. Do you have a half a minute down a channel? Yeah, I mean, I've already called a couple weeks ago, I think, so it said I wasn't interested. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 7:35:48 AM\ncompany_name - Chartwell, Inc.\ncontact_first_name - Tim\ncontact_last_name - Herrick\ncontact_country - \ncontact_job_industry - \ncontact_job_level - \ncontact_status - Contacted - Disqualified\ncall_disposition - No Referral\nuser_name - Paul Ahlefeld\ncontact_job_title - Director, Sales\ncall_talk_time - 24 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_Chartwell,Inc._T_Herrick_NoReferral.mp3
