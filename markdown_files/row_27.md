So um you know it can be extremely frustrating Trying to get enough conversations to hit your numbers But I believe we've discovered a breakthrough that unlocks a powerful sales channel That's live conversations like the one we're having right now and we're not as i-lors CRM or lead gen Reason I call today angel was to see if we get some time up to share the connect and sell breakthrough Which happened to have about 15 minutes available in the next couple weeks for a quick call But what what is it?
