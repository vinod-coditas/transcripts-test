Call Transcript:\n Hey, Chris, this is Sean with Connect and Fill. How are you doing today? Doing well, Sean. How are you doing? I'm doing well. Thanks. I'll be a super brief. I know I'm in an eruption 27-6 years time. I'll tell you what I call. Does that work? Sure. Okay. I'm actually, I'm in a call right now, though, on a video call. Is this related to business or? It is. But I can call you back. I don't want to interrupt what you're doing there. That'd be fine. Okay. Appreciate it, man. All right.
