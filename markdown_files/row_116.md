Call Transcript:\n Hi, this is Jana. Hey, Jeremy here with Connect and Cell. How's it going? Hi, how are you? Fantastic, thank you. But I do know I'm in an eruption right now. So, wonder if I could address this task on 27 seconds to take away call? Sure. What's that thank you? So, I'm obviously in sales myself, right? So, I know how frustrating it can be when your team is just trying to get it up conversations with decision makers so that you all can hit your numbers. I believe we've discovered a breakthrough in a lots of powerful sales channel, live conversations, just like the one we're having right now. And it's not a dialogue, lead gen data provider, anything like that. It's a new space we pioneered. And that's the reason I was reaching out. Was looking to get even 15 minutes on your calendar to share that breakthrough with you. You have your calendar handy? All of our stuff is handled through corporate. Oh. Thank you. Who should I talk with at the moment? \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 1:17:00 PM\ncompany_name - Simon\ncontact_first_name - Jana\ncontact_last_name - Griswold\ncontact_country - United States\ncontact_job_industry - Software\ncontact_job_level - Director\ncontact_status - Contacted - Disqualified\ncall_disposition - No Referral\nuser_name - Jeremy Lamb\ncontact_job_title - Director, Marketing & Business Development\ncall_talk_time - 66 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_Simon_J_Griswold_NoReferral.mp3
