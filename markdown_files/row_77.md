Call Transcript:\n Chrome connect until how's it going? Let it go. Hey, can you hear me okay? Oh, I can't now. Yeah, hi. Hey, Bill. I know I'm an interruption. Kind of 27 seconds to tell you why I call. Make it quick. Sure thing. Yeah, so you know, you can be extremely illustrating trying to get enough conversations to hit your numbers. But I believe we've discovered a breakthrough that unlocked a powerful sales channel. It's live conversations like the one we're having right now on demand. And we're not a dialer, CRM, or lead gen. Reason I call today Bill is to see if we can put some time up to share the connect-and-sell breakthrough. Would you have about 15 minutes available in the next couple weeks? I'm actually now because I just started a new position with the material. So maybe sometime after that you can touch base with me. All right. Like a couple months. Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you. Great. Thanks so much Bill. All right. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 7:57:33 AM\ncompany_name - Paschall Truck Lines\ncontact_first_name - Bill\ncontact_last_name - Cosentino\ncontact_country - United States\ncontact_job_industry - Transportation\ncontact_job_level - VP\ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Future Interest\nuser_name - Patrick Smith\ncontact_job_title - VP Sales - Midwest\ncall_talk_time - 62 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_PaschallTruckLines_B_Cosentino_FutureInterest.mp3
