Call Transcript:\n Hi, this is Holy. Hey, Steve with Connect and Cell. We spoke all the way back in March and you shared with me at that time that you were between positions. I just had a note to follow up here to see if it made better since now. Maybe to put 15 minutes on the calendar. Over the next one or two weeks or so. Yeah, I'm still in between. Hopefully that will change as we enter in the new. Alrighty, sir. I wish you all the luck. And if it's cool, reach back out next year. Good. Sounds great. I appreciate it. You got it. Bye. Thanks. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 1:11:41 PM\ncompany_name - Movable, Inc.\ncontact_first_name - Lalit\ncontact_last_name - Chopra\ncontact_country - United States\ncontact_job_industry - \ncontact_job_level - \ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Bad Timing\nuser_name - Steve Cooperman\ncontact_job_title - Vice President, Business Development\ncall_talk_time - 40 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_Movable,Inc._L_Chopra_BadTiming.mp3
