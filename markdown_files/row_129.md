Call Transcript:\n Hi, this is Becky. I'm calling from Connect and Cell and I know I'm an interruption. Can I have 27 seconds to tell you what I call? Now is not a great time. No, I just have a minimal meeting. I understand. I'll call another time and have a great day. I'm fine. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 12:37:44 PM\ncompany_name - UPS\ncontact_first_name - Izek\ncontact_last_name - Jasper\ncontact_country - United States\ncontact_job_industry - Transportation\ncontact_job_level - Director\ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Busy\nuser_name - Becky Benson\ncontact_job_title - Director, Sales\ncall_talk_time - 22 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_UPS_I_Jasper_Busy.mp3
