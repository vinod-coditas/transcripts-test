Call Transcript:\n Hey Steve, nature with Connection Style. How are you doing today? Very good, Ariel. I'm good. I appreciate you asking. I know I'm an interruption. I'm hoping I caught you at a decent time. We spoke back in June about my company Connection Style. I was reaching out today to see if you'd have a few minutes for a conversation around the company. I'm not sure if it rings the bell. What services do you have? We just help teams have targeted conversations with those hard to reach decision makers or clients that they're looking to do. No, thanks. Not interested yet. Just that. Okay. Okay. I guess back when we spoke in June. Thank you. Yes. Bye. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 10:14:55 AM\ncompany_name - PCTEL\ncontact_first_name - Steve\ncontact_last_name - Sendele\ncontact_country - \ncontact_job_industry - \ncontact_job_level - \ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Brush-off\nuser_name - Nathan Merrill\ncontact_job_title - Sales Director\ncall_talk_time - 44 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_PCTEL_S_Sendele_Brush-off.mp3
