I know you get a lot of calls in a while. So you actually call you back in October. It was a really busy invitation to do so. I raised you back out to you to schedule a few minutes, plan your calendar. If there are plans for expansion of growth for a new market for 2024. You were interested, but it's just of course timing, Dr. SÃ¶ber was exactly right. I'll be honest with you, we are growing too fast at this point. There's a lot going on and we're growing at rapid speed. Right now, I don't think I'm interested at the moment. There's just way too much going on at this point.
