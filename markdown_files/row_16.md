Call Transcript:\n Hello, Vanston. Yeah, hey James, hi, it's Paul over at Connected Cell. We connected briefly on the 13th of September. You were busy and asked me to send an email and follow up at a better time. Do you have a half a minute down the chair? Sorry, no. Well, in September, I've just had two reasons. And I'm just trying to get caught up with everything. Sure. Yeah, sorry. And then I'm going to the falcons for two weeks. Oh goodness. So maybe a server. Yeah, it's just, yes, incredibly busy at the moment. Oh, that's a good thing though. No worries. I'll give you a call then. Thanks for your time. All right. Thanks, cheers. Bye-bye. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 6:20:24 AM\ncompany_name - Adas\ncontact_first_name - James\ncontact_last_name - Dunn\ncontact_country - \ncontact_job_industry - \ncontact_job_level - \ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Busy\nuser_name - Paul Ahlefeld\ncontact_job_title - Technical Director, Business Development\ncall_talk_time - 46 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_Adas_J_Dunn_Busy.mp3
