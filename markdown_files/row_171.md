Call Transcript:\n Good job. Hey, Josh. And you here with Connection, so how are you doing today? Good. What can I help you with? Yeah, I know I'm an interruption. Reaching back out, we spoke a little bit ago back in May. I've actually set aside a few minutes for you to speak with one of my colleagues, John Allen. I'm not sure if my name or company rings a bell. But if you're not, but you actually caught me in the middle of something, so I apologize, but I'm not happy that you go. I actually thought you were the part to calling the end that I'm expecting the fall for. Oh, definitely, definitely. Yeah, sorry about that. Sorry about that. I'll try it next week. Hopefully catch you later. Thank you. Of course, thanks, Josh. Bye-bye. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 1:11:12 PM\ncompany_name - Simpay\ncontact_first_name - Josh\ncontact_last_name - Elsass\ncontact_country - United States\ncontact_job_industry - \ncontact_job_level - C-Level\ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Bad Timing\nuser_name - Nathan Merrill\ncontact_job_title - Chief Sales Officer\ncall_talk_time - 36 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_Simpay_J_Elsass_BadTiming.mp3
