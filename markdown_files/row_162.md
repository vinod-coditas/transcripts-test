Call Transcript:\n Good afternoon. Thank you for calling, visit Lake Geneva. My name is Meg. How may I help you? Meg, is Vienna in today? Vienna is out of the office right now. Do you have her phone number? I don't. I thought this was it. I'm sorry. No, I'll give it to you. It's 262. I would transfer you, but the last person I transferred somehow didn't go through. So 262, 812, 0021. Okay, perfect. I will get a hold of her. Thank you so much. Sure. Bye-bye. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 10:25:45 AM\ncompany_name - Visit Lake Geneva\ncontact_first_name - Deanna\ncontact_last_name - Goodwin\ncontact_country - \ncontact_job_industry - \ncontact_job_level - \ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Busy\nuser_name - Adam Willis\ncontact_job_title - Vice President of Marketing, Communications & Development\ncall_talk_time - 37 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_VisitLakeGeneva_D_Goodwin_Busy.mp3
