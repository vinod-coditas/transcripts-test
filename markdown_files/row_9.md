Call Transcript:\n Connect and sell. How's it going? Good. Good. Good. Thanks for asking. Daniel, I know I'm an interruption. I have 27 seconds to tell you why I called. You got 27 seconds. Thanks. I appreciate your time. So, you know, it can be extremely frustrating trying to get enough conversations to hit your numbers. But I believe we've discovered a breakthrough that unlocks a powerful sales channel. That's live conversations like the one we're having right now. And we're not a dialer, CRM, or lead gen. Reason I called to say Daniel was to see if we could set some time up to share the Connect and sell breakthrough. Would you have about 15 minutes available in the next couple weeks for a quick call? No, I'm not interested. Thank you for calling. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 6:07:25 AM\ncompany_name - NEWS10 ABC\ncontact_first_name - Daniel\ncontact_last_name - Straub\ncontact_country - United States\ncontact_job_industry - Media & Internet\ncontact_job_level - Director\ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Brush-off\nuser_name - Patrick Smith\ncontact_job_title - Director, Sales\ncall_talk_time - 49 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_NEWS10ABC_D_Straub_Brush-off.mp3
