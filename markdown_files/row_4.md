Call Transcript:\n Hey, this is Patrick from Connect and Cell. How's it going? Good. Hey, Friswa. I know I'm an interruption. I have 27 seconds to tell you why I called. Sure. Thanks, I appreciate your time. It can be extremely frustrating trying to get enough conversations to hit your numbers. But we've discovered a break through that unlocks a powerful supply conversation like the one we're having right now on demand. And we're not as highly aware of that. Thank you very much. I'm not the one that's broken by organization. You mentioned my boss, so thank you. Thank you, Friswa. Okay. We should have been reaching out to you. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 5:47:04 AM\ncompany_name - VIVVIX\ncontact_first_name - FranÃ§ois\ncontact_last_name - Tremblay\ncontact_country - United States\ncontact_job_industry - Business Services\ncontact_job_level - Director\ncontact_status - Contacted - Disqualified\ncall_disposition - No Referral\nuser_name - Patrick Smith\ncontact_job_title - Senior Sales Director\ncall_talk_time - 47 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_VIVVIX_F_Tremblay_NoReferral.mp3
