Call Transcript:\n Hi Debbie, it's all over at the right time. We could have briefly backed on the 27th of September you were at lunch and asked me to give you a call back at a better time. Do you have a half a minute to chat now? I'm actually just about to get out and then I'll call you back. Could you just mind me what it was about? Well, I was actually calling to introduce the company Connector Cell. I could send off an email instead that has a video that would give you a better idea. I don't think I have your correct email though. I have Debbie.allens at anddiamondmobiletech.com. I take it that summer. Oh it is! I got something great. Great. I'll send it off to you in the fall for another time. Thanks for your time today. Thank you. Bye bye. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 6:09:04 AM\ncompany_name - Argenx\ncontact_first_name - Debbie\ncontact_last_name - Allen\ncontact_country - \ncontact_job_industry - \ncontact_job_level - \ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Busy\nuser_name - Paul Ahlefeld\ncontact_job_title - Senior VP, Business Development\ncall_talk_time - 55 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_Argenx_D_Allen_Busy.mp3
