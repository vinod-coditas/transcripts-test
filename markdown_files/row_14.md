Call Transcript:\n Hello Jim. Hey, this is Patrick from Connect and Cell. How's it going? Fine Patrick, what can I do for you? Jim, I know I'm an interruption. Can I have 27 seconds to tell you why I call? Go ahead, bud. Thanks. Thanks for your time. So, you know, it can be extremely frustrating trying to get enough conversations to hit your numbers. But I believe we've discovered a breakthrough that unlocks a powerful sales channel. That's live conversations like what we're having right now on demand. And I went out as a dialer, CRM, or lead gen. Reason I call to James was to see if we could set some time up to share the Connect and Cell breakthrough. Would you have about 15 minutes available in the next couple weeks? Not in charge of that, Patrick. I appreciate it. Thanks, bud. Okay. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 6:19:02 AM\ncompany_name - Quinnox\ncontact_first_name - Jim\ncontact_last_name - Davignon\ncontact_country - United States\ncontact_job_industry - Business Services\ncontact_job_level - Director\ncontact_status - Contacted - Disqualified\ncall_disposition - No Referral\nuser_name - Patrick Smith\ncontact_job_title - Director, SAP Sales\ncall_talk_time - 48 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_Quinnox_J_Davignon_NoReferral.mp3
