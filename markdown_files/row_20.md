Call Transcript:\n Paul over at Connect and Cell. Well, we spoke back in March about Connect and Cell and he said that to give you a call back later in the year or see if it might make more sense to have a further conversation at that time. How you been? Yeah, probably not a good talk. Yeah, I didn't give me a bad idea next year. You got it. All right. Thanks for your time. Have a good one. Cheers. Bye. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 6:35:04 AM\ncompany_name - Token Inc\ncontact_first_name - Michael\ncontact_last_name - Lane\ncontact_country - \ncontact_job_industry - \ncontact_job_level - \ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Bad Timing\nuser_name - Paul Ahlefeld\ncontact_job_title - Vice President Sales\ncall_talk_time - 29 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_TokenInc_M_Lane_BadTiming.mp3
