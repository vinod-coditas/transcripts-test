Call Transcript:\n So I was a cod. Hey, Steve with us in this cell. We spoke to our gosh. Last time was back in June and you shared with me at that time that you were between positions, unfortunately, and I just had a note here to follow up to Steve at the better time now to put us 15 minutes on the calendar. Maybe you'll spend a minute. No, I'm still on the search vote. God, sir. All right, I will wish you good luck and maybe you have follow up next year or so if that's cool. Okay, that sounds great. Thanks for the follow up. You got it, sir. Good luck. Thanks Todd. Thanks, Todd. Bye. \n\n Call Metadata: \ncall_date - 10/4/2023 1:04:10 PM\ncompany_name - Harmonize\ncontact_first_name - Todd\ncontact_last_name - Vecellio\ncontact_country - United States\ncontact_job_industry - \ncontact_job_level - \ncontact_status - Contacted - Qualifying\ncall_disposition - Bad Timing\nuser_name - Steve Cooperman\ncontact_job_title - Enterprise Sales Director\ncall_talk_time - 38 Seconds\nfile_name - uploads/10_04_2023_Harmonize_T_Vecellio_BadTiming.mp3
